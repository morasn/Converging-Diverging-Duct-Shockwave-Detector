# Converging-Diverging-Duct-Shockwave-Detector
This project focuses on developing a MATLAB tool to evaluate the location of a traveling shockwave in a converging-diverging (CD) duct. The tool allows users to input various parameters, simulate the conditions within the duct, and visualize the results.
